# data_mining_rest_app
The aim of this project was to create a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to allow an
end user to store and retrieve data and execute a data mining algorithm on stored datasets.

To achieve this, I have chosen to create a client-server application using Representational State
Transfer (REST) principles using the python framework Flask. This application will contain the APIs to
store and retrieve data and run a data mining algorithm on the data.
